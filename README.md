SythWave is a theme created to express what Batocera is all about. Starting with the background I tried to capture what is mainly associated with Batocera as a whole which tends to lean towards a retro 1980's Synthwave/Retrowave/Vaporwave feel. With that feeling of going back to the 80's I felt it was appropriate to incorporate scanlines, neon pink boxes, stars, and the Iconic Batocera logo with the triangle background (this tends to be a common trend amoung the three). I wanted SynthWave to shift away a little from the typical Retrowave/Vaporwave feel. I wanted to try and capture it as a whole individual so I looked at the splash image that Batocera starts up with as my guide and insperation for this theme.
